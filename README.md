Spawn parallel AI coding agents, each in its own git worktree. Agents autonomously fix CI failures, address review comments, and open PRs — you supervise from one dashboard.

Agent Orchestrator manages fleets of AI coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. Each agent gets its own git worktree, its own branch, and its own PR. When CI fails, the agent fixes it. When reviewers leave comments, the agent addresses them. You only get pulled in when human judgment is needed.

**Agent-agnostic** (Claude Code, Codex, Aider) · **Runtime-agnostic** (tmux, Docker) · **Tracker-agnostic** (GitHub, Linear)

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org), [Git 2.25+](https://git-scm.com), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing), [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com). Install tmux via `brew install tmux` (macOS) or `sudo apt install tmux` (Linux).

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @composio/ao
```

If `npm install -g` fails with EACCES, prefix with `sudo` or [fix your npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

To install from source (for contributors):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator.git
cd agent-orchestrator && bash scripts/setup.sh
```

</details>

### Start

Point it at any repo — it clones, configures, and launches the dashboard in one command:

```bash
ao start https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
```

Or from inside an existing local repo:

```bash
cd ~/your-project && ao start
```

That's it. The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:3000` and the orchestrator agent starts managing your project.

### Add more projects

```bash
ao start ~/path/to/another-repo
```

## How It Works

1. **You start** — `ao start` launches the dashboard and an orchestrator agent
2. **Orchestrator spawns workers** — each issue gets its own agent in an isolated git worktree
3. **Agents work autonomously** — they read code, write tests, create PRs
4. **Reactions handle feedback** — CI failures and review comments are automatically routed back to the agent
5. **You review and merge** — you only get pulled in when human judgment is needed

The orchestrator agent uses the [AO CLI](docs/CLI.md) internally to manage sessions. You don't need to learn or use the CLI — the dashboard and orchestrator handle everything.

## Configuration

`ao start` auto-generates `agent-orchestrator.yaml` with sensible defaults. You can edit it afterwards to customize behavior:

```yaml
# agent-orchestrator.yaml
# Runtime data is auto-derived under ~/.agent-orchestrator/{hash}-{projectId}/
port: 3000

defaults:
  runtime: tmux
  agent: claude-code
  workspace: worktree
  notifiers: [desktop]

projects:
  my-app:
    repo: owner/my-app
    path: ~/my-app
    defaultBranch: main
    sessionPrefix: app

reactions:
  ci-failed:
    auto: true
    action: send-to-agent
    retries: 2
  changes-requested:
    auto: true
    action: send-to-agent
    escalateAfter: 30m
  approved-and-green:
    auto: false # flip to true for auto-merge
    action: notify
```

CI fails → agent gets the logs and fixes it. Reviewer requests changes → agent addresses them. PR approved with green CI → you get a notification to merge.

See [`agent-orchestrator.yaml.example`](agent-orchestrator.yaml.example) for the full reference, or run `ao config-help` for the complete schema.

### Using Docker runtime

Docker is opt-in. The local default stays `tmux`, but you can switch a project or a single startup to Docker when you want isolation or a reproducible server/CI environment.

```yaml
projects:
  my-app:
    repo: owner/my-app
    path: ~/my-app
    defaultBranch: main
    runtime: docker
    runtimeConfig:
      image: ghcr.io/composio/ao:latest
      limits:
        cpus: 2
        memory: 4g
      readOnlyRoot: true
      capDrop: [ALL]
      tmpfs: [/tmp]
```

You can also override runtime per command:

```bash
ao start --runtime docker --runtime-image ghcr.io/composio/ao:latest
ao spawn 123 --runtime docker --runtime-image ghcr.io/composio/ao:latest
ao spawn 123 --runtime docker --runtime-memory 4g --runtime-cpus 2 --runtime-read-only
```

Or persist runtime selection in config:

```bash
ao runtime show
ao runtime set docker my-app --image ghcr.io/composio/ao:latest --memory 4g --cpus 2 --read-only
ao runtime clear my-app
```

`ao runtime set <name>` without a project updates `defaults.runtime`. For Docker, the project form is usually the right choice because `runtimeConfig.image` is stored per project.

Your Docker image must include the basics AO expects to drive an interactive agent session:

- `/bin/sh` (or the shell you set in `runtimeConfig.shell`)
- `tmux`
- `git`
- The agent CLI you plan to run inside the container (`claude`, `codex`, `aider`, etc.)
- Any auth material that CLI expects, usually through environment variables in the container

AO bind-mounts the project workspace into the container at the same absolute host path. That keeps agent tooling and terminal attach behavior consistent, but it also means Docker must be able to access that host path.

When present on the host, AO also mounts common local auth/config state into `/home/ao` inside the container:

- `~/.codex`
- `~/.gitconfig`
- `~/.git-credentials`
- `~/.config/gh`

That is enough for real Codex, Git, and GitHub-backed sessions to reuse local login state in typical setups, as long as the image also includes the corresponding CLIs.

CLI attach, `ao open`, and the web dashboard terminal are runtime-aware. For Docker sessions they attach with `docker exec ... tmux attach`, not host tmux.

Recommended for servers:

- Prefer rootless Docker on Linux
- Use a pinned image instead of `latest` for reproducibility
- Add `readOnlyRoot`, `capDrop`, and explicit CPU/memory limits for multi-tenant hosts
- Keep `tmpfs: [/tmp]` when using `readOnlyRoot`; many agent CLIs and shells still expect a writable `/tmp`
- Expect a one-time Codex workspace trust prompt the first time a brand-new worktree path is opened in-container
- Use `ao doctor` after changing Docker runtime config; it now checks Docker daemon access and warns about missing image/rootless/GPU setup

## Plugin Architecture

Seven plugin slots. Lifecycle stays in core.

| Slot      | Default     | Alternatives             |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Runtime   | tmux        | process                  |
| Agent     | claude-code | codex, aider, opencode   |
| Workspace | worktree    | clone                    |
| Tracker   | github      | linear, gitlab           |
| SCM       | github      | gitlab                   |
| Notifier  | desktop     | slack, discord, composio, webhook, openclaw |
| Terminal  | iterm2      | web                      |

All interfaces defined in [`packages/core/src/types.ts`](packages/core/src/types.ts). A plugin implements one interface and exports a `PluginModule`. That's it.

## Why Agent Orchestrator?

Running one AI agent in a terminal is easy. Running 30 across different issues, branches, and PRs is a coordination problem.

**Without orchestration**, you manually: create branches, start agents, check if they're stuck, read CI failures, forward review comments, track which PRs are ready to merge, clean up when done.

**With Agent Orchestrator**, you: `ao start` and walk away. The system handles isolation, feedback routing, and status tracking. You review PRs and make decisions — the rest is automated.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. The plugin system makes it straightforward to add support for new agents, runtimes, trackers, and notification channels. Every plugin is an implementation of a TypeScript interface — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the pattern.
